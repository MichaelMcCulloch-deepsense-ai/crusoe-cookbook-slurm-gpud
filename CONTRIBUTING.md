# Content
Articles in the cookbook should cater to developers and focus on providing information or enabling a workflow in a neutral, objective tone. When an article features third-party software, it should be for the purposes of enablement and not promotion or endorsement.

## Define the audience
Each article should have a clear audience in mind and answer:
* Who will read this content?
* What are they trying to do?

## Define the outcomes
Each article should have a clear outcome and focus on 1 or 2 key accomplishments. If an article stretches beyond 2 goals, consider breaking it up into separate tutorials.
