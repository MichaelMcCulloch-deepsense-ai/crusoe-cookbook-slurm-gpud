# Crusoe Cookbook
Inspired by the [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook), this contains examples for common workflows on Crusoe Cloud. To provision resources, first [create an account](https://console.crusoecloud.com/request), then configure the [Crusoe CLI](https://github.com/crusoecloud/cli) and [terraform](https://github.com/crusoecloud/terraform-provider-crusoe?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started). For tasks requiring more than one node, we recommend provisioning via terraform and provide `.tf` files for reproducible builds.

# Content
Each recipe is contained in its own subfolder under `content/` and includes a README along with provisioning scripts and source code.

# Contributing
We aim for this cookbook to be a reference for best practices when building on GPU clouds and welcome community contributions to refine, grow, and share knowledge in this space. Please refer to our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/crusoecloud/crusoe-cookbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting a PR.
